## Leunbach test equating using R

This package aims to implement the Leunbach test equating procedures in
the software [DIGRAM](https://biostat.ku.dk/DIGRAM/), created by Svend
Kreiner and Karl Bang Christensen. Both direct and indirect equating is
implemented.

The equating procedure is described in detail in the [Additional file

related to this article: Adroher, N. D., Kreiner, S., Young, C., Mills,
R., & Tennant, A. (2019). Test equating sleep scales: Applying the
Leunbach’s model. *BMC Medical Research Methodology, 19*(1), 141.

## Installation

This package is not yet available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
and needs to be installed directly from this code repository. You can do
this in multiple ways, I suggest either using `pak` or `remotes` (or
`devtools`).

If you want to use parallel processing, which speeds up the bootstrap
procedure considerably, you should also install the package `mirai`.

First, install the [`pak`](https://pak.r-lib.org/) package, if you don’t
already have it installed:

``` r
install.packages('pak')
```

Then install the package.

``` r
pak::pkg_install("pgmj/leunbachR")
```

If you have the `remotes` or `devtools` package installed, you can
instead use:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pgmj/leunbachR")
```

or

``` r
devtools::install_github("pgmj/leunbachR")
```

There is an [intro
article](https://pgmj.github.io/leunbachR/articles/intro.html) under the
heading Articles at the top of this page, showing the basic
functionality.
