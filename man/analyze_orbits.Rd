\usage{
analyze_orbits(fit, alpha = 0.05, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A leunbach_ipf object from leunbach_ipf()}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for critical values (default 0.05)}

}
\value{
A list of class "leunbach_orbits" containing:
\itemize{
\item orbits: Matrix of expected percentages within each total score
\item left_right:  Cumulative probabilities P(X ≤ x | S = s)
\item right_left: Cumulative probabilities P(X ≥ x | S = s)
\item crit_left: Critical values for left tail by total score
\item crit_right: Critical values for right tail by total score
\item crit_values: Combined critical values (two-tailed)
\item expected_critical: Expected number of persons with significant differences
\item variance_expected: Variance of expected critical count
\item n_significant: Number of observed persons with significant differences
\item orbit_df:  Degrees of freedom for each orbit
}
}
\description{
Performs orbit analysis for the Leunbach model.  For each total score (orbit),
computes the expected distribution of (Test1, Test2) score pairs and
cumulative probabilities for assessing person fit.
}
\details{
For each total score S = X + Y, the orbit consists of all valid (X, Y) pairs.
The expected probability of each cell within an orbit is:
P(X = x | S = s) = (gamma_x * delta_y) / sigma_s

Cumulative probabilities are computed in both directions:
\itemize{
\item Left-to-right: P(X ≤ x | S = s) - tests if Test1 score is unusually low
\item Right-to-left: P(X ≥ x | S = s) - tests if Test1 score is unusually high
}
