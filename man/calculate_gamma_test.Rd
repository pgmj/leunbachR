\title{Calculate Goodman-Kruskal Gamma and test statistic}
\usage{
calculate_gamma_test(observed, expected)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Observed contingency table}

\item{expected}{Expected (fitted) contingency table}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item gamma_observed: Gamma coefficient for observed data
\item gamma_expected: Gamma coefficient for expected data
\item se_gamma:  Standard error of gamma
\item z_statistic: Z statistic (expected - observed) / SE
\item p_value: One-sided p-value from standard normal
}
}
\description{
Computes Goodman & Kruskal's Gamma coefficient for both observed and
expected tables, and tests whether they differ significantly.
Gamma measures the strength of association between two ordinal variables.
Uses a one-sided test following the DIGRAM implementation.
