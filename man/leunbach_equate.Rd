\title{Equate Scores Between Tests using Leunbach Model}
\usage{
leunbach_equate(
  fit,
  direction = c("1to2", "2to1"),
  method = c("optimize", "newton"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A leunbach_ipf object from leunbach_ipf()}

\item{direction}{Direction of equating: "1to2" (Test1 to Test2) or "2to1" (Test2 to Test1)}

\item{method}{Optimization method for person parameter estimation:
"optimize" (default) uses stats::optimize() with Brent's method,
"newton" uses custom Newton-Raphson with bisection fallback}

\item{verbose}{Print detailed output}
}
\value{
A list of class "leunbach_equating" containing:
\itemize{
\item equating_table: Data frame with original scores, expected equated scores, and rounded scores
\item direction: Direction of equating
\item method: Optimization method used
\item fit: Original leunbach_ipf object
}
}
\description{
Creates equating tables to convert scores from one test to another using
the estimated score parameters from the Leunbach model.
